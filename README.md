# Working on all versions 
* but it lands as windows pro version each time... for windows 10 (maybe fixed with the kms server list updated, but did not verify that it indeed validates on all versions of windows 10. )


# change log 

* updated kms servers to validate on
* windows11 sl0ppyvator
* windows10 sl0ppyvator

# Todo
* improve it for all version win 10. 

# non active kms validation issue? 
Open a ticket and i will spin a new fresh updated version, with the latest checked kms servers of the tool out.
